INTERMEDIATE JAVASCRIPT

# Review: Array Methods #

:seedling: Great job! :seedling:  

In this unit, we learned to use five built-in JavaScript methods to iterate through an array as well as learned how to find new ones using JavaScript documentation.

<br />

**To Recap:**

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `forEach()` | executes a function once for each element in array |
| `map()`     | calls a function on each element in array & creates new array with results |
| `filter()`  | creates new array with elements that pass a test specified by a function |
| `sort()`    | sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array |
| `reduce()`  | apply a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from L-to-R) as to reduce it to a single value |

<br />

**Documentation:** [www.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

<br />

It should also be noted that while ES5 is readily supported by most browsers (roughly 98%), if there is a concern that users may not have ES5 availble in their browsers, developers should use an external library that supplies their own iteration methods (such as [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) or [Closure](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/)).
