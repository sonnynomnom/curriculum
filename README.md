INTERMEDIATE JAVASCRIPT

# Introduction #

Welcome to _Intermediate JavaScript_!  

Hopefully you have completed the [Learn JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript) course and are eager to tackle some more intermediate level material.

By the end of this course, you'll have a good sense of how JavaScript is used by professional developers. Not only will you see a selection of in-depth examples, you will also learn how to write full-fledged progams in JavaScript.

This unit has four parts:

1. Learn built-in methods for array iteration / manipulation
2. Understand binding of `this` in callback functions
3. Learn to use arrrow functions
4. Combine your new knowledge on a fun project

Make sure to take notes and pace yourself. Good luck!
